title: Ultimate 3D printer guide for beginners
description: As a fellow who just bought a 3d printer, I know how hard it is to get started. So, I decided to write a guide for beginners to help them get started with 3d printing.

# Planning

There are 2 types of 3D printers: FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) and SLA (Stereolithography). FDM printers are more common and cheaper, but SLA printers produce higher quality prints. I recommend starting with an FDM printer, as they are easier to use and maintain.

# Buying a 3D printer

When buying a 3D printer, consider the following factors:

- Build volume: The size of the objects you can print.
- Filament type: The material used for printing (PLA, ABS, PETG, etc.).
- Print quality: The resolution of the prints.
- Price: The cost of the printer.

Some popular 3D printers for beginners are the Creality Ender 3, Anycubic i3 Mega, and Prusa i3 MK3.

# Bed leveling and calibration

For broke people that cannot afford a bambulab 3D printer, then you have to level the bed and calibrate the printer. This is essential for getting good prints. There are many tutorials online that can help you with this process.

For my step of calibrating the printer, I used a piece of paper to adjust the height of the nozzle above the bed. This ensures that the first layer sticks properly to the bed. I also double-checked with a gauge to make sure the bed was level.

Don't worry if you don't get it right the first time. It takes practice to get the hang of it.

# Slicing software

To prepare your 3D models for printing, you need to use slicing software. This software converts your 3D model into a series of layers that the printer can understand. Some popular slicing software are Cura, PrusaSlicer, and Simplify3D.
For my printer Elegoo Neptune 4, I mostly use Orca slicer. It is a free slicer that is easy to use and produces good results and it's open-source so anyone can contribute to it.

Thank you for reading my guide. I hope it helps you get started with 3D printing. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the comments below. Happy printing!
