# Student Life at Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU)

Greetings, future TMU students! As a current engineering student at Toronto Metropolitan University, I've decided to share my experiences with the courses I've taken. I believe that understanding your academic challenges can help you overcome them. Here's a glimpse of what you might encounter during your time at TMU.

## MTH140 - Calculus 1
**Difficulty: 5/10**

This course delves into high school pre-calculus and calculus. Topics include advanced functions, limits, continuity, and differentiation. I had the privilege of learning from Prof. Majed El-Qasas, a wizard in making math seem easy. Evaluation consisted of three tests (30% each) and weekly quizzes (10%).

## CEN100 - Introduction to Engineering
**Difficulty: 0/10**

This class provided an overview of various engineering branches and their functions. It involved enjoyable projects, though I would have preferred them in person. Iclickers were used, graded for accuracy (10%). The final was straightforward if you paid attention, resulting in an A-/A grade.

## PCS211 - Physics: Mechanics
**Difficulty: âˆž/10**

Taught by Prof. Catherine Beachemin, this course simplified physics ideas. However, self-teaching was necessary due to the rigorous grading. Expect to dedicate significant time to physics problems.

## MTH141 - Linear Algebra
**Difficulty: 8/10**

A challenging math class, especially without prior knowledge of vectors. The fast-paced course required intense focus and extensive practice.

## CHY102 - Chemistry
**Difficulty: 4/10**

Despite my initial dislike for chemistry, this class became a favorite. Exceptional professors made complex concepts easy to understand. Asynchronous lessons with a full week for completion were a plus.

## PHL110 - Philosophy of Religions
**Difficulty: 8/10**

My least favorite class, taken as a liberal requirement. Grading included attendance (10%), three quizzes (20% each), and a term paper (30%). Not recommended unless deeply interested in philosophy and religions.

## FRE201 - Introductory French II
**Difficulty: 5/10**

An okay class for those familiar with French. The professor was helpful, and with a bit of concentration and homework, it's manageable.

## ECN801 - Engineering Economics
**Difficulty: 7/10**

A challenging course focusing on interest rates, time periods, present/future values, MMAR, IRR, etc. Calculations were complex, but I simplified the process using a programmed Excel sheet. I recommend this approach to future engineering students.

I'll update with more experiences in the near future!
