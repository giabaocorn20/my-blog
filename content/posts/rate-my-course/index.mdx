# Student Life at Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU)

Greetings, future TMU students! As a current engineering student at Toronto Metropolitan University, I've decided to share my experiences with the courses I've taken. I believe that understanding your academic challenges can help you overcome them. Here's a glimpse of what you might encounter during your time at TMU.

##
### MTH140 - Calculus 1
**Difficulty: 5/10**

This course delves into high school pre-calculus and calculus. Topics include advanced functions, limits, continuity, and differentiation. I had the privilege of learning from Prof. Majed El-Qasas, a wizard in making math seem easy. Evaluation consisted of three tests (30% each) and weekly quizzes (10%).

### CEN100 - Introduction to Engineering
**Difficulty: 0/10**

This class provided an overview of various engineering branches and their functions. It involved enjoyable projects, though I would have preferred them in person. Iclickers were used, graded for accuracy (10%). The final was straightforward if you paid attention, resulting in an A-/A grade.

### PCS211 - Physics: Mechanics
**Difficulty: âˆž/10**

Taught by Prof. Catherine Beachemin, this course simplified physics ideas. However, self-teaching was necessary due to the rigorous grading. Expect to dedicate significant time to physics problems.

### MTH141 - Linear Algebra
**Difficulty: 8/10**

A challenging math class, especially without prior knowledge of vectors. The fast-paced course required intense focus and extensive practice.

### CHY102 - Chemistry
**Difficulty: 4/10**

Despite my initial dislike for chemistry, this class became a favorite. Exceptional professors made complex concepts easy to understand. Asynchronous lessons with a full week for completion were a plus.

### PHL110 - Philosophy of Religions
**Difficulty: 8/10**

My least favorite class, taken as a liberal requirement. Grading included attendance (10%), three quizzes (20% each), and a term paper (30%). Not recommended unless deeply interested in philosophy and religions.

### FRE201 - Introductory French II
**Difficulty: 5/10**

An okay class for those familiar with French. The professor was helpful, and with a bit of concentration and homework, it's manageable.

### ECN801 - Engineering Economics
**Difficulty: 7/10**

A challenging course focusing on interest rates, time periods, present/future values, MMAR, IRR, etc. Calculations were complex, but I simplified the process using a programmed Excel sheet. I recommend this approach to future engineering students.

[Check out my Excel sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1alKPBq-gp0N3wXtiheqiC0PdVfmqGHj9UCT4bmhMPeg/edit?usp=sharing).

### MTH240 - Calculus 2
**Difficulty: 7/10**
I found this course more challenging than Calculus 1. The professor was excellent, but the material was complex since it involved integration, series, and sequences. I recommend practicing regularly to grasp the concepts.

### PCS125 - Physics: Waves and Fields
**Difficulty: 6/10**
This course was more manageable than PCS211. The professor was engaging, and the material was easier to understand. I recommend attending lectures and practicing regularly to succeed.

### ELE202 - Electrical Circuits Analysis
**Difficulty: 1/10**
I would not say its a challenging course since most of the material was covered in high school. The professor was excellent, and the labs were fun. Some friends i know found it challenging though, so it depends on your background.

### CPS188 - Computer Programming Fundementals
**Difficulty: 3/10**
COmpletely bird course, the professor was excellent and the material was easy to understand. You would definitely learn C programming in this course, however its only like starter C so if you want to be in the industry then more practice is needed on your own.

## Year 2
### MTH312 - Calculus 3
**Difficulty: 8/10**
This course was challenging, especially since it involved 3D calculus. The professor was excellent, but the material was complex especially since it involved partial derivatives, multiple integrals, and vector calculus and its only getting harder. I recommend practicing regularly to grasp the concepts.

### COE318 - Software Systems
**Difficulty: 6/10**
Course that is meant to be for software engineering students, however, it is a good course for all engineering students to take. The professor was excellent, and the material was easy to understand. The labs were fun and the assignments were challenging but doable. You would learn Java in this course. But since this course is running by the Department of Engineering not Computer Science, you would have to do code on paper!

### COE328 - Digital Systems
**Difficulty: 7/10**
It's all about bits and binary and basic hardware design. The professor was excellent, and the material was easy to understand. The labs were fun and the assignments were challenging but doable. You would learn VHDL in this course.

### ELE302 - Electric Networks
**Difficulty: 8/10**
For this course you would learn more in depth of common electrical circuits and how to analyze them. The Prof is a hit or miss, but the material is ok, but they would get rushed at the end of the semester just like how i got it in ELE202 so be prepared for that.

### CMN432 - Communication in the Engineering Profession
**Difficulty: 2/10**
I barely even went to this class, the only thing that you need to concern for this course is you would get in a team at the start of the semester and y'all would have a big report at the end so be careful with who you choose.

### COE428 - Engineering Algorithms and Data Structures
**Difficulty: 8/10**
This course is a must for all engineering students, I love this course by the way. YOu will learn about algorithms and data structures and how to implement them in C. The professor was excellent, and the material was easy to understand. The labs were fun and the assignments were challenging but doable.

### COE528 - Computer Oriented Engineering Analysis and Design
**Difficulty: 9/10**
I hate this course so much, it's all about software engineering and how to design software. The lectures are boring and the assignments are hard. The professor was ok, but the material was complex especially since it involved UML, design patterns, and software architecture.

### ELE404 - Electronic circuits
**Difficulty: 7/10**
This course is all about electronic circuits and how to analyze them. Fei Yuan is the goat, and the material was easy to understand. The labs were fun and the assignments were challenging but doable. You would learn about transistors and diodes in this course.

### MTH 314 - Discrete Mathematics for Engineers
**Difficulty: 6/10**
I would say it's an ok course, the material is not that challenging and it is mostly logics and proofs. You will pass this course don't worry

'll update with more experiences in the near future!
