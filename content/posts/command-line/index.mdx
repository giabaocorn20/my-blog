Most people interact with computers using graphical user interfaces (GUIs), such as Windows or Mac OS. However, Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) offer a text-based way to interact with machines.

### What is an OS

Operating systems (OS) are crucial for managing hardware and coordinating tasks. They act as the interface between users and applications.

Unix, designed to replace punched cards, introduced a modular design philosophy with simple tools and a shell for command execution.

### Introduction on the Command Line

#### Anatomy of Commands

Commands have a basic structure: `utility_name parameter1 parameter2 ... parameterN`. Options start with a dash (`-`), and arguments are objects on which the command acts.

#### Command history

Interactive command history access allows reusing and modifying commands, enhancing efficiency.

#### Ending Your Session

Terminating a command-line session can be done by closing the terminal window or using the `exit` command.

## File System

A file system organizes files into directories. The working directory is where the terminal's session is located.

### Working Directory

The **current working directory** (cwd) is where the shell is running. Commands like `pwd` and `ls` help navigate and list directory contents.

### Modifying the Filesystem

#### Creating Directories

Use `mkdir` to create directories, following POSIX standards for naming conventions.

#### Deleting Directories

Empty directories can be removed with the `rmdir` command.

#### Copying Files

Copying files with `cp` requires caution to avoid overwriting existing files. Interactive mode (`-i`) can prevent accidental overwrites.

#### Moving and Renaming Directories and Files

The `mv` command efficiently moves and renames files without requiring a recursive flag.

## Glob Patterns and Wildcards

Glob patterns, similar to regular expressions, help match filenames. Wildcards like `*` and `?` facilitate flexible pattern matching.

### The `*` Wildcard

`*` matches any character, any number of times, except for leading dots (`.`).

### Escaping Characters

Use a backslash (`\`) to escape characters' special meanings in glob patterns.

### The Wildcard `[]`

Square brackets allow matching specific characters, providing more control over patterns.

## User and Permissions

### Users

Users have distinct permissions for system security. Commands like `whoami` and `id` reveal user information.

### Groups

Groups categorize users for efficient permission management. The `groups` command lists user groups.

### Permissions

File permissions, applied to owners, groups, and others, control access. The `chmod` command modifies permissions.

### The superuser

The root user, with UID 0, has elevated privileges. `sudo` allows users to execute commands with superuser privileges.

## File Inspection

### Text Files

Text files store data and code. Commands like `head`, `tail`, `wc`, and `file` aid in inspecting and understanding text files.

### Type of Files

Use the `file` command to identify a file's type.

## Text Processing

Text processing involves tasks like reformatting, extracting, and modifying text files. Commands like `cat`, `grep`, and `sed` are powerful tools.

### Concatenate

`cat` concatenates and displays file content. It's commonly used to combine files.

### `Grep`

`grep` searches for patterns in text using regular expressions. It's a versatile tool for filtering content.

## Redirection and Pipelines

Redirection and pipelines enhance command flexibility.

### Redirecting Output with `>`

The `>` operator redirects command output to a file, creating or overwriting the file.

### Redirecting Output with `>>`

The `>>` operator appends command output to a file.

### Pipelines

Pipelines (`|`) connect commands, allowing output from one command to serve as input for another.

## Standard Streams and File Descriptors

Processes communicate through standard streams: stdin, stdout, and stderr.

### Duplicating File Descriptors

`2>&1` duplicates stderr into stdout. Understanding file descriptors helps manage command input and output effectively.
