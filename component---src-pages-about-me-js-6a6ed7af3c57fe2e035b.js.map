I'm Bao, also known as Jason, currently pursuing my studies in electrical engineering at\r\n          Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU). Nature, particularly Physics and Maths, has always captivated my\r\n          interest. Back in secondary school, I delved into the world of Mathematics, and it became a passion.</p>\r\n        <p>As a curious kid, topics like chip design and software engineering always fascinated me. When the time came\r\n          to choose a major for university, it was a no-brainer â€“ engineering it was!</p>\r\n        <p>Beyond academics, I enjoy expanding my skill set. Whether it's diving into new programming languages or\r\n          exploring the latest technology trends, I love learning. Occasionally, I embark on DIY projects found online,\r\n          turning free time into a fun and creative outlet. When I'm not occupied with studies or projects, you'll find\r\n          me working out, sipping on coffee or Coke, indulging in croissants, and taking nighttime strolls around the\r\n          city. Neon Genesis Evangelion holds the title of my all-time favorite anime.</p>\r\n        <p>I am a perfectionist. I want to solve the problems in my hands in perfect ways, which is, however, not\r\n          achievable in many situations. I also apply Bellman Equation in the optimization of my life, which is a Markov\r\n          decision process, but the future discount factor in the equation might be small and I would often be trapped\r\n          in local optimum.</p>\r\n        <figure>\r\n          <img src=\"../avatar.jpg\" alt=\"Cute Image\" />\r\n          <figcaption style={{ textAlign: 'center', color: '#888' }} >This is a cute image description.</figcaption>\r\n        </figure>\r\n        <h2>About This Site</h2>\r\n        <p>This is the second time I build my personal website.
